# Contributing to AppNehmen
ðŸŽ‰ Thanks for considering to contribute to AppNehmen! ðŸŽ‰
Just a few things:
- Please open a Github issue first and discuss your proposed change.
  Your new feature may take the app in a direction I don't want it to go. If all else fails feel free to just fork the whole thing and
  do what you like with it. ðŸ˜Š
- If you do a PR please make sure to provide adequate unit test coverage.
- Please make sure, there are no linting errors and all changes are formatted according to the `.editorconfig` settings. I recommend
  using the Prettier plugin with your editor of choice.
